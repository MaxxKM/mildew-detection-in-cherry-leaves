        f"a critical challenge in their cherry orchards:  \n\n"
        f"distinguishing healthy cherry leaves from those "
        f"affected by powdery mildew. Powdery mildew can \n"
        f"significantly impact crop yield and quality, and "
        f"early detection is vital for effective management.  \n\n"
        f"To support their efforts, Farm & Foody tasked us "
        f"with developing a solution to visually differentiate\n"
        f"healthy leaves from those showing signs of this "
        f"fungal disease. Additionally, the client is keen on\n"
        f"leveraging predictive tools to classify cherry leaves "
        f"based on their health status, enabling more"
        f"precise and timely interventions.\n\n"
        f"Our project focuses on creating a reliable, efficient, "
        f"and scalable system that meets Farm & Foodyâ€™s\n"
        f"needs for disease detection and prediction, "
        f"ensuring healthier crops and optimized operations."
